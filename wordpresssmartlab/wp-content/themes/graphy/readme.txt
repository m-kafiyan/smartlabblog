Graphy
==============================

Graphy is a WordPress theme for blogs that are designed to have beautiful typography. It is developed using mobile-first responsive design, ensuring that your blog will be no less beautiful when viewed on a smartphone or tablet.

Graphy has five widgets available (one sidebar, four footers), and using the sidebar widget also enables you to make a two-column design. In addition, footer widget display is automatically adjusted depending on how many are used.

Graphy also supports Customizer, Custom Menu, and Custom Header, enabling flexible configuration.
